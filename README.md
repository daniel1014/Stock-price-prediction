# Stock-price-prediction
This is a dissertation project of stock price prediction using supervised learning models.
Both the classical learning model (Polynomial Regression & SVR) and time series model (ARIMA) have been used to predict the stock prices and evaluated against their performance. 
This project incorporated different datasets such as the stock prices, Covid-19 new cases, a composite index of government responses against Covid-19 (OxCGRT), CPI, and unemployment rate. 
The results reveal that SVR with good parameters outperforms other traditional models. We also find that incorporating macroeconomic factors improve the forecast performance of the classical learning models, indicating the significance of macroeconomic factors since the emergence of the pandemic.
