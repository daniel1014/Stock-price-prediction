# Stock-price-prediction
Dissertation Project 

This project analyze stock price predictoin using supervised learning models. 

Both classical learning model (Polynomial Regression & SVR) and time series model (ARIMA) have been used to predict the stock prices and evaluated against their performance. 

This project incorporated different datasets such as the actual stock prices, Covid-19 new cases, a composite index of government responses against Covid-19 (OxCGRT), CPI, and unemployment rate. 

The results reveal that SVR outperforms other traditional models. We also find that incorporating macroeconomic factors improve the forecast performance of the classical learning models, indicating the significance of macroeconomic factors since the emergence of the pandemic.
